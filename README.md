## **Research Project (Summer 2025)**
During Summer 2025, Nick Baldev worked with Professor Michael Wehar to create a code editor intended for educational use cases. Additionally, this code editor was tailored for usage in Michael Wehar's continuing CS Education research project called [AlgoArt](https://github.com/Algorithmically-Generated-Artwork/Drawing-Program) which is a platform (available @ [AlgoArt.org](https://algoart.org)) for algorithmic art generation. It required a lightweight and easy to embed code editor that would allow users to modify the algorithms directly within the browser. Since the existing code editors that were tested had several problems, Michael and Nick decided to create one from scratch.
